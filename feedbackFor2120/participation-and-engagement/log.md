description: Log of participation in class community spaces

This semester I acknowledge that I did not speak a lot in class during class-wide discussions, and instead was able to communicate better in small project groups. I have diagnosed performance anxiety, meaning that I get anxiety triggers from speaking in front of large amounts of people (speeches, presentations, answering group questions), so for the most part that is why I seemed quiet. I liked small discussions more because I was able to talk with the people that I was familiar with, and better communicate my thoughts. I followed along with the leetcode assignments, and that definitely helped me to understand the different implementations and ways in which you can use data structures for real-world applications. 

DISCLAIMER- I did not keep a running log of the specific ways in which I contributed to class discussions, meaning the exact topics that my questions pertained to. I just asked questions based on curiosity or clarification.
