During week 13 me and my partner had our presentation on Ch17 of the philosophy of software design book. THe chapter highlighted the importance of consistency when programming and organization of code to help prevent against bugs, typos, and miscommunications. THe author emphaized the importance of following the styling conventions of the particular language you are using, so that it is more readable to other programmers.

We also talked about Tries, which are a type of tree data structure. It is used for things like word search, autocomplete, or word validation. THere are at most 3 child nodes to one parent node, and we can then perform a search to find the tree path that points to the word that we were searching for.
