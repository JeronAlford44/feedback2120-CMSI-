During these weeks we basically learned the syntax of java, and the pros and cons to the language. The style of java itself felt completely new to me, with function and operation having to be contained within some sort of class. I used a w3 schools tutorial to help me learn more, as well as looking at Dr. Fourney's notes https://www.w3schools.com/java/
