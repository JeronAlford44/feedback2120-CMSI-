description: Feb 20â€“Mar 17 (enjoy spring break!)
During these weeks we looked at the purpose and usefullness of stacks and queues as data structures, and what types of applications they might entail. We also examined the differences between them and learned to discern in what areas a certain data structure would perform better in. Our main example in class was looking at how to effectively manage the inventory and order of dogs and cats coming in and out of a shelter. We decided to build a queue, with many helper functions as part of the class. One such function was ->

code: public void enqueue(Animal a){
		/* Keep track of order of arrival, 
		regardless of species */
		a.setOrder(order);
		order++;

		if(a instanceof Dog){
			dogs.add(Dog a);
		} else if(a instanceof Cat){
			cats.add(Cat a);
		}
	}
